'INdyn'		parameters for propagation and initial wavefunction: 
	width, deviation from starting geometry defined in 'INxyz', momenta, mass

'INxyz'		parameters for model potentials + 5 parameters  relevant for any dynamics + starting geometry 
Esh == overall shift of the potential if doing  DFTB
ch  == bond distance for atoms 1&2
bnd == deviation of the bond distance  from ch when atom1 is considered bonded to atom2 for probability caclulation
qmn,qmx == range of z-coordinates of atom 1 outside of which a QT will  be ingored, i.e. its weight =0 in trot

'IN_dftb'	specifies parameters for DFTB 	
2         ! ntype, number of atom types
2 1       ! lmax(iat): 1 ... ntype, this number is the max number of orbitals needed for different atoms,
 C is atom 1 and H is atom 2 here, *.spl files are in order according to this atom number 
'cc.spl', 'ch-g2ms.spl', 'hc-g2ms.spl', 'hh.spl'
NOTE Electronic temperature  is defined in derivs()

dftb patameters are echoed in 'out.dftb'
