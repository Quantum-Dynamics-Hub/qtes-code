   In subroutine read_input_mpi

	(1) read all dynamics parameters from IN*: number of traj, time steps etc 
	    those are passed to all subsequent steps 

	(2) if trajectories to be generated from |psi(0)|, which is ist=0, then initial time tc =0
	     AND the trajectories will be subsequently generated by init_traj

	(3) if trajectories to  be read from file 'traj.sav', which ist=1, then initial time 
	 is read from that file and the number of steps kmax is adjusted to achieve the final time from IN*  

	the trajectories are also read from 'traj.sav' but they are not passed to the cores  
	AND they are subsequently read again by set_traj from 'traj.sav' 

	(4) initial buffers for the trajectory-related  arrays


  Call to read_input_mpi is followed by the calls from main to 

init_traj if ist.eq.0
set_traj if ist.eq.1


### define the quantum force 
in qtes.f  reading input INdyn

variable ipot: 

! ipot definition: 0:= QP=0; 1:= global LQF for all QDOFs; 2-3:= uncoupled fit for every quantum z-coord
! 2:= linear basis, 3:= quadratic basis; ELSE the fit is  coupled within (x,y,z) of a quantum atom 
! but uncoupled between the atoms; 4:= linear basis; 7:= diagonal quadratic;  10:= full quadratic basis
! basis function order f=[x,y,z,x^2,y^2,z^2,xy,xz,yz,1] f=1 is always the last basis function no matter nb
